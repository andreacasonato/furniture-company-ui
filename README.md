# Furniture Company Interactive Website

This is a fun project made to include a number of JS features.
There are 2 pages, the homepage and filtering page.

### The homepage includes:
- Hamburger menu
- Statistics counter
- FAQ accordion
- Modal popup

### On the filtering page (products page):
- Products show dynamically on the filtering page 
- Search box and filter buttons on the left

A great way for me to exercise:
- Functions
- Objects
- Array methods
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Destructuring
